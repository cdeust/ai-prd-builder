## How Can I Contribute?

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **System information** (macOS version, Xcode version, etc.)
- **Relevant logs or error messages**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When suggesting an enhancement:

- **Use a clear title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the proposed functionality
- **Explain why** this enhancement would be useful
- **List any alternatives** you've considered

### üîß Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Simple issues for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### üìù Pull Requests

1. **Small, focused PRs**: One feature or fix per PR
2. **Include tests**: All new code requires tests
3. **Update documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code
4. **Follow style guidelines**: Use SwiftLint

## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test improvements

### Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** in logical commits
3. **Write/update tests** for your changes
4. **Run tests locally** to ensure nothing breaks
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with clear description

## Style Guidelines

### Swift Code Style

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) with these additions:

```swift
// MARK: - Good Example
public struct PRDGenerator {
    private let orchestrator: Orchestrator

    public init(orchestrator: Orchestrator) {
        self.orchestrator = orchestrator
    }

    public func generate(from input: String) async throws -> PRD {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// MARK: - Avoid
struct prd_generator {  // Wrong naming
    var Orchestrator: Orchestrator  // Wrong capitalization

    func Generate(input: String) -> PRD {  // Wrong naming, missing async/throws
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Key Principles

- **Clarity over brevity**: Clear names and explicit types when helpful
- **Constants in separate files**: Use dedicated Constants files
- **Error handling**: Always use proper error handling with throws
- **Async/await**: Use modern concurrency for async operations
- **Access control**: Be explicit with public/private/internal

### Documentation

- **Public APIs**: Must have documentation comments
- **Complex logic**: Include explanatory comments
- **TODOs**: Allowed but must include issue number

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes

```

## Pull Request Process
