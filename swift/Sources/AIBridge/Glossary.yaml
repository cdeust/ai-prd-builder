# Glossary.yaml
# Business-editable glossary of acronyms by domain.
# Guidelines:
# - Only edit values below. Keep the structure (domains -> domain -> entries).
# - Supported domains today: product, engineering, design, marketing.
#   You may add more domains, but unsupported ones will be ignored until the app supports them.
# - Acronym keys are case-insensitive in the app; uppercase is recommended.
# - Avoid duplicate acronyms within the same domain. If duplicates exist, the last one wins.
# - Use quotes if values contain special characters like ":" or start with numbers.
